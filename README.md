# SCOM & Nagios PHP Dashboard
This is simple PHP dashboard for Nagios and Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. It uses Nagios "status.dat" file for showing Nagios service/host statuses and SCOM e-mail functions to show its alerts(using PHP IMAP).

#About this project
This is the first release of this dashboard and as I'm not very good developer, the code needs alot of tweaking. I am trying to update and fix it as much as possible. If you'd like to help me out, feel free to do so. Dashboard uses GPLv3 license.
